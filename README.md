# ‚ú® HAAMOON idle notifier

An Electron application that monitors your active window titles and classifies them as "studying" or "gaming" based on the `config.json` file. It plays helpful and motivational audio notifications to encourage you to spend more time studying and less time gaming.

## üì• Installation

Download the Windows installer: 

[haamoon_idle_notifier.Setup.1.0.0.exe](https://github.com/AssortedFood/HAAMOON_idle_notifier/releases/download/latest/haamoon_idle_notifier.Setup.1.0.0.exe)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the configuration file at `config/config.json` to specify keywords:
```json
{
  "studying": ["Google Chrome", "Excel", "Visual Studio Code"],
  "gaming": ["Dolphin", "Runelite", "lichess"],
  "audio": {
    "good": "good.mp3",
    "bad": "bad.mp3",
    "neutral": "neutral.mp3"
  }
}
```


If you want to replace the audio files you can do that by replacing the files `good.mp3` and `bad.mp3` in the `audio/` folder.

*This version of the application does not support neutral motivation, only good and bad.*
